# Object Oriented Programming in Python

print(type("hello"))

Output: <class 'str'>
This is because "hello" is an object of a string

x = 1 
print(type(x))

Output: <class 'int'>


def hello():
    print("hello")

print(type(hello))

Output: <class 'function'>

This is known as built-in function 


# KEY NOTES
# self is passed as the first argument to every method of a class / This instance of a class
# For example if the car is volvo, the self will be volvo
# If the car is BMW, the self will become BMW

# initializer is to set the initial attributes to the state of the object

E.g:

class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand: str, fuel_type: str) -> None: #Return None
    self.brand = brand
    self.fuel_type = fuel_type

volvo : Car = Car(brand="Volvo",fuel_type="Diesel") #This will be passed as the first argument which is self
